Option 3

FSA Table is located in scanner.cpp
Driver:

testScanner receives a character and sends to filter1(). After some processing, the character is sent to scanner which called checkCharacter.  checkCharacter is the workhorse of my scanner.  if checkCharacter finishes a token, sends it to filter2().  filter2() sends the token back to testScanner which prints it.  If checkCharacter did not complete a token, it continues to receive characters until it does.


filter1() calls scanner() calls checkCharacter() calls filter2()

I did test against the suggestions in P1 Testing and they all passed.  I also tested a number of my own edge cases.
I am sure there's additional error conditins that needs to be included in my FSA Table.

My error messaging could be improved.  Error messages are generic and only tell the user what line number and the character being processed.

I made a big a change to my FSA table during development.  Previous i was processing every delimiter and operator as their own characters.  I no longer believe that's really necessary as the scanner
should not care what the delimiter or operator is only that it is a delimiter or operator.
My graph is thus, no longer representative of my table.


I will upload my graph on canvas.  Please note that i made this graph first and there may have been implemmentation decisions made during coding that the graph may not be 100% exactly
what is going on in the code.  There was some element of having to finesse the execution of the character checking.
