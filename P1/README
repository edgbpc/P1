Option 3

FSA Table is located in scanner.cpp
Driver:
filter1() calls scanner() calls checkCharacter() calls filter2()

I did test against the suggestions in P1 Testing and they all passed.  I also tested a number of my own edge cases.
I am sure there's additional error conditins that needs to be included in my FSA Table.
Also need to improve the error messaging that the user receives.

I will upload my graph on canvas.  Please note that i made this graph first and there may have been implemmentation decisions made during coding that the graph may not be 100% exactly
what is going on in the code.  There was some element of having to finesse the execution of the character checking.
